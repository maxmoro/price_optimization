## Contribution Guidelines

Please follow the guidelines mentioned in the [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). In short, all development should happen on your local feature/bugfix branch. Once you are ready, submit a pull request to the `develop` branch. After another person reviews this for merge conflicts and other issues, this can be merged to the `develop` branch. Every so often, we can relese a version of our work to the `master` branch (which is the public facing branch).
